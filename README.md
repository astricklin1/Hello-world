# Hello-world
This is my hello world project for getting my Github up and running
Hi! My name is Austin Stricklin and I am an aspiring data scientist looking to begin my journey into Data Science. I am new to working inside of Github, but hope over time to get a good grasp on github and put different projects inside of here.
